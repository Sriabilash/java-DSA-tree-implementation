# 🌳 Java Tree Data Structure Implementation

This project provides a clean and well-documented **Java implementation of tree data structures**, focusing primarily on **Binary Trees** and **Binary Search Trees (BSTs)**. It's designed for educational purposes and to help students understand tree-based algorithms as part of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice.
